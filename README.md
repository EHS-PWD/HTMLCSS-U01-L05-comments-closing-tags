### Lesson 5: Comments and Closing Tags

#### **Objective:**

After learning about the importance of comments and closing tags in HTML, students will extend their previous HTML document to demonstrate proper use of comments for code documentation and ensure all HTML tags are properly closed. This assignment will assess their understanding of how to maintain clean and well-structured HTML code.

### **Step-by-Step Guide:**

1. **Open Your Existing HTML Document:**

   - [ ] Open the `index.html` file you created in Lessons 1 to 4.

2. **Ensure Proper Closing of All Tags:**

   - [ ] Carefully review your existing HTML document and verify that every HTML tag (e.g., `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<body>`, etc.) has a corresponding closing tag.
   - [ ] Example of a properly closed paragraph:
     ```html
     <p>This is a paragraph with a properly closed tag.</p>
     ```

3. **Add Comments to Document Your Code:**

   - [ ] Begin adding comments to explain each section of your HTML code. Comments should describe the purpose of key elements and sections in your document.
   - [ ] Example comments:

     ```html
     <!-- This is the main heading of the webpage -->
     <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>

     <!-- This paragraph explains the purpose of the webpage -->
     <p>
       This is a simple web page created to demonstrate my understanding of HTML
       structure.
     </p>
     ```

4. **Add Comments Explaining Nesting and Closing Tags:**

   - [ ] Add a comment explaining why proper nesting and closing of tags are important:
     ```html
     <!-- The above section demonstrates correct nesting of HTML elements within a <div> tag -->
     <!-- Proper nesting and closing of tags help ensure the webpage is rendered correctly in all browsers. -->
     ```

5. **Ensure Proper Nesting Throughout the Document:**

   - [ ] Go through the entire HTML document and ensure that all tags are properly nested.
   - [ ] Proper nesting means that each tag is correctly placed inside its parent tag without overlapping or missing closing tags.
   - [ ] Check for empty lines of code: Make sure that there are no unnecessary empty lines between the tags that could break proper structure.

6. **Save Your Work:**

   - [ ] Save the file as `index.html`.

7. **Test Your HTML Document:**

   - [ ] Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
   - [ ] Verify that the webpage displays properly with all tags properly closed and content structured as expected.

8. **Submit Your Work:**
   - [ ] Once you have confirmed that your tags are correctly closed and comments are properly used, submit the updated `index.html` file to the class assignment folder or through the schoolâ€™s learning management system.

### **Assessment Criteria:**

- Proper closing of all HTML tags in the document.
- Clear and meaningful use of comments to document the code.
- Submission of the updated `index.html` file.
